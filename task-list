* edit checkLegalMove to include checking that the user can only play on the board that is indicated by the other players previous move
* make a 'solver', with a function that takes in all legal moves/all boards it can play on, and returns a move
  - can be just a randomized move for now
* somehow indicate to the user which boards can be played on (through terminal? colors on pygame window?)
